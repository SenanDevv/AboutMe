# Skills IN Detail
  
- .NET Technologies - NET, C#, ASP.Net MVC & Core, ASP.Net API development (+Core), WPF (MVVM), Xamarin,
Web Forms - I am highly proficient in a range of .NET technologies, including C#, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, and ASP.NET API development. My experience extends to developing desktop applications using WPF and WinForms, where I have implemented the MVVM design pattern to maintain clean separations of concerns. Additionally, I have developed mobile applications using Xamarin and the MvvmCross librarys. In these projects, I've also used the MediatR library to decouple message handling for better maintainability.

- FrontEnd - JQuery, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript (native and JQuery), AJAX, AngularJS - My expertise in web development is comprehensive, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and AJAX. I have also worked with modern JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS, Angular, and React, using Redux for state management and TypeScript to enforce strong typing, which enhances code quality and robustness. My focus has always been on building interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
- Database Management - MS SQLServer, PostgreSQL, SQLite, AWS S3 - I possess strong skills in database management with MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. My work includes initializing projects, designing database schemas, establishing relationships, and creating tables, procedures, functions, and views, all while ensuring optimized SQL practices. I'm also adept at managing data storage solutions like AWS S3.
- ORMs - EF Core, Dapper, ADO.NET. I have extensive experience with ORMs such as EF Core, Dapper, and ADO.NET, using both code-first and database-first approaches. This experience has equipped me with the skills to efficiently manage data operations within applications, ensuring smooth data integration and manipulation.
- Version Control and Project Management Tools - Git, Github, Gitlab, Jira, Confluence, Team Foundation Server (TFS) - I am well-versed in using various version control systems such as Git, GitHub, and GitLab. Additionally, I have experience with project management and documentation tools like Jira and Confluence, and I have also worked with Team Foundation Server (TFS) for code management and team collaboration.
- Containerization and Orchestration - Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service, Service Mesh (Istio with Kiali), Azure
DevOps Services, ECS -  I have considerable experience with Docker and Kubernetes, including setting up and managing containers using the Azure Kubernetes Service and Amazon ECS. My experience extends to configuring service meshes like Istio with Kiali to monitor and control microservices efficiently

- Messaging and Integration - AWS SNS & SQS, RabbitMQ, AWS Lambda - In the realm of integrations, I have utilized AWS SNS & SQS, RabbitMQ, and AWS Lambda to build scalable, event-driven architectures. This has included setting up message brokers for reliable message queuing and processing, which are critical for asynchronous communication patterns in distributed systems.

- Software Design and Testing - Software Design Patterns (Decorator, Adapter, Proxy), CQRS, Mediator, Dependency
Injection, Onion Architecture, TDD, Unit Testing (xUnit, NUnit), Integration Testing,
Automation Testing, Agile & Scrum - I am adept in applying various software design patterns such as Decorator, Adapter, and Proxy. My development practices also include Onion Architecture to maintain core independence and modularity. I rigorously implement TDD and conduct both unit testing (using xUnit, NUnit) and integration testing to ensure robust and error-free code. My testing regime is complemented by automation testing to streamline the testing process and Agile & Scrum methodologies to enhance project agility and team responsiveness.
